Revision history for Tephra

Version	Date	Location
0.09.4	

- Log final masking results of complete TE library against the reference when the 'all' command
  is executed.

0.09.3	09/09/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Fix Vmatch clean command name for removing index files.
- Add TRIM retrotransposons annotation to family-level classifications for
  LTR retrotransposons.
- Remove unclassified LTR retrotransposon FASTA file used for family-level classifications. This is essentially a temp file and keeping this along with the FASTA of classified elements is redundant and confusing.
- Add separate roles for logging, command execution, and Tephra subcommand execution.
- Add a parent class for running all Tephra commands in the 'all' subcommand.
- Add Annotation::Util method to get repeat name and superfamily code from transposon ID.
- Reduce method calls by passing log object to command execution methods instead of generating log
 object for each method call.
- Adjust logging method in family-level classification method for LTR/TIR elements in order align results in the log for different transposons types.
- Clean up fai index after test completion.
- Clean up masking log files from 'all' command at completion.
- Document --verbose option for 'findnonltrs' command, and change logging behavior so all output goes
to STDERR.


0.09.2	08/08/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fixes for 'tirage' and 'all' commands to correctly parse family name from the TIR
  GFF3 and add these to the summary file. The family-generation method for TIR elements 
  was added in v0.09.0 and the parser in the Tephra::TIR::TIRStats class was not updated 
  to parse the 'family' attribute.
 
0.09.1	07/24/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for length/identity summary file with header being printed for each family.

0.09.0	07/10/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Add family-level classification methods for TIR, Helitron, and non-LTR retrotransposons.
  These methods are now in the Tephra::Classify::Any class.
- Standarize FASTA and GFF3 ID formats for TIR, Helitron and non-LTR retrotransposons. All TEs
  now have the same FASTA header format (">familyNumber_elementID_chromosome_start_end"), and GFF3
  ID format ("ID=elementID;family=familyNumber;...").
- Move Tephra::LTR::MakeExemplars to Tephra::Annotation::MakeExemplars and add
  some abstraction so the methods now work for finding TIR exemplars also.
- Change Tephra::Classify::LTRFams and subclasses to the more abstract
  Tephra::Classify::Fams and modify class methods to work for LTR and TIR elements.
- The --all option to 'tirage' is no longer required since family annotations are 
  modeled the same way as for LTR retrotransposons. It is now possible to omit the --all
  option and only calculate age on the top N families.
- Add method to calculate the global similarity within a TE family and log the results
  when the 'all' command is run.
- Add RIL clades to superfamily mapping method in Tephra::Annotation::Util class.
- Adjust IDs of non-LTR and Helitron elements to be SO compliant and not require
  and tricks for sorting. This standarizes ID formats for TE types.
- Add method to install and configure Vmatch during the build process.
- Remove development flag for tests involving Vmatch ('classifyltrs', 'classifytirs', and
  'maskref'). Now these tests will be run on each build and not just manually.

0.08.1	06/12/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for non_LTR_retrotransposon IDs getting dropped in final GFF3.

0.08.0	06/07/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for Helitron IDs getting dropped in final GFF3 file.
- Bug fix for sorting unclassified matches in LTRFams class. Hits are now sorted
  and scored as expected.
- Bug fix for not using output filename from the configuration file. A custom name was
  being generated for the GFF3 and the configuration option was previously ignored.
- Bug fix for leaving empty solo-LTR files when none are discovered. Now a warning is
  logged when no solo-LTRs are found and the empty files are removed.
- Bug fix for generating expected help menus with long and short options.
- Bug fix for classifytirs test not testing the correct command for all tests.
- Bug fix for not cleaning up all intermediate results from 'all' command as expected (this
  only affected the 'findtrims' and 'ltrage' commands).
- Bug fix for not getting substitution rate from configuration file and using default.
- Bug fix for not cleaning up results from ltrage and tirage commands.
- Modify behavior of 'run_blast' method in Tephra::Role::Run::Blast role. The sort
  attribute now takes a string to specify how to sort: either by coordinate or bit score.
  Also, the option to set the e-value threshold was added.
- Add 'findfragments' command (and Tephra::Genome::FragmentSearch class with associated 
  methods) for identifying truncated or fragmented elements.
- Refactor 'trim_search' method in Tephra::TRIM::TRIMSearch class to take the mode for the
  search ('relaxed' or 'strict') and set variables accordingly instead of duplicating
  code across two separate methods.
- Refactor 'ltr_search' method in Tephra::LTR::LTRSearch class to take the mode for the
  search ('relaxed' or 'strict') and set variables accordingly instead of duplicating
  code across two separate methods.
- Refactor how genometools commands are run and evaluated.
- Refactor all tests to avoid using the shell for running commands.
- Refactor 'findltrs' and 'findtrims' tests to not retry failed tests.
- Renumber test files so they are sequential with not numbers being skipped.
- Add longer usage description to main program and all subcommands.
- Document default thread level for all commands that can use more than one process.
- Add the option to use more than one processor for 'findltrs', 'findtirs', and 'findtrims'
  commands.
- Change the default thread level for tests to 2 (was set much higher, 24, for local
  testing).
- Add 'tirage' command results to 'all' subcommand. 
- Add method to combine and summarize TIR and LTR age results by family to 'all' command. 
- Add Tephra::Annotation::Util class for working with transposon names.

0.07.2	05/11/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Add configuration option for 'findltrs' command to filter elements based on the 
  lack of coding domains. This reduces the number of unclassifed elements.
- Remove duplicated warning about missing logfile option in Tephra::LTR::LTRRefine
  class.

0.07.1	04/03/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Add bug fix for genome attribute not being defined when refining TRIM elements.
- Check if domain matches are defined prior to evaluation in Tephra::NonLTR::Postprocess.

0.07.0	03/06/2017	Vancouver, BC

- Add 'all' command to run all commands and generate combined FASTA and GFF3 output
  files.
- Modify configuration for 'findltrs' command and add configuration class (Teprha::Config::Reader)
  for running all methods.
- Bug fix for 'classifytirs' command to add 3-letter superfamily code to GFF3 file as an attribute.
- Add logger for all methods.
- Add new tests for all command and logging methods.
- Bug fix for cleaning GT index files (method was incorrectly searching subdirectories).
- Simplify setting HTS index for 'classifytirs' method. Now the index is created once and passed
  to individual classification methods instead of recreating indexes for each method.
- Simplify running 'findltrs' command by setting all options in configuration file instead of having
  a mix of command line options and configuration file.
- Document --clean option for 'maskref' command.
- Document --debug option for 'classifyltrs' command.
- Correct documentation for 'findtrims' and 'tirage' commands by removing mention of LTR files.
- Change 'percentcov' option for 'sololtr' command to be an integer instead of a fraction to be
  consistent with other class options.
- Fix description of 'matchlen' option for 'sololtr' command to reflect proper usage (requires
  an integer not a fraction).
- Add repeat database file to output of 'maskref' command for better logging. 
- Add better regex for getting GFF3 sequence declarations so as to not capture section dividers.
- Add check and clean up of empty files with 'findtrims' command when no elements are discovered.
- Add check for count of elements with 'classifyltrs' and 'classifytirs' command so as to not
  trigger warnings when trying to calculate statistics and format the output.
- Deprecated the percent coverage threshold option for 'sololtr' command. The match length and
  percent identity are sufficient to filter weak matches and the coverage option added complexity
  to the usage and implementation.
- Change 'ltrage' command to take classified LTRs directory as input and process all superfamilies
  instead of taking individual superfamily directories as input.
- Fix bug in 'ltrage' command for getting LTR exemplar seqs. A variable that was not being initialized
  was tested against for how to process exemplars.
- Bug fix with trying to resolve the configuration directory if it is not set at installation.
- Bug fix with setting BLAST+ directory by removing version from local directory name.

0.06.1	2/09/17	Vancouver, BC

- Add method to evaluate whether the BLAST-merging step increases the number of elements
  in families for 'classifyltrs' command over the domain-based clustering method. 
  For plants, the BLAST-merging step is routinely used for family-level designations and leads
  to fewer singletons. For animals, or species with divergent LTR elements, the BLAST-merging
  step will create all singletons and no elements in families, so evaluating both procedures
  is the current best general approach to classification of LTR families.
- Bug fix for 'findtrims' command that was exiting when no elements were found under strict 
  conditions. Now this is handled correctly and output will be written.
- Bug fix that was creating duplicate sequence region declarations in GFF3 for 'findnonltrs' command
  on some genomes.
- Add tests to see if hmmsearch report was parsed correctly and all fields defined with 'findnonltrs'
  command.
- Modify processing of input with 'findnonltrs' command to return generated files directly.
- Bug fix for 'sololtr' command to use SO compliant terms in GFF3 output.
- Adjust output of 'maskref' command to account for different run lengths when formatting results
  table.
- Add some error handling for 'maskref' command when there is an issue with the input (or no input genome
  file can be found). Now it should die with a message instead of throwing warnings and generating an 
  empty table.

0.06.0	1/25/17	Vancouver, BC

- Clean up file paths across in all classes to use absolute paths instead
  of relative to avoid problems.
- Modify handling of genometools index files to not assume they are in the working directory.
  This ensures they will be cleaned up as expected.
- Reduce output of 'findltrs' and 'findtrims' commands to GFF3 only.
- Add --debug option for 'findtrims' command.
- Add -o output file option for 'findtrims' command to clarify what result files are generated.
- Reduce memory usage with 'findhelitrons' command and clean up intermediate files.
- Add checks for required input files to 'maskref' command.
- Modify output of 'findnonltrs' command to have identical basename for FASTA/GFF3.
- Modify output	of 'classifyltrs' command to have identical basename for FASTA/GFF3.
- Modify output of 'findtirs' command to have identical basename for FASTA/GFF3.
- Modify output of 'findtrims' command to have identical basename for FASTA/GFF3.
- Modify output of 'findhelitrons' command to have identical basename for FASTA/GFF3.
- Modify output of 'classifytirs' command to have identical basename for FASTA/GFF3.
- Change short option for input GFF3 to 'classifytirs' command to '-i' for consistency.
- Trim end of translated file with 'findnonltrs' command and silence trivial warnings during 
  translation.
- Remove alignment files generated by 'illrecomb' command by default.
- Add correct 3-letter code to FASTA output of 'findtrims' command for getting the type
  when generating masking report.
- Fix bug that was causing chromosomes to not be indexed with 'findnonltrs' command.
- Fix bug that was causing warnings from 'maskref' command due to alignments not being reported.

0.05.0	1/12/17	Vancouver, BC

- Add test to 'sololtr' command to ensure the expected file of LTR exemplar sequences
  exists.
- Add requirement of a filename for --seq option with 'sololtr' command, which makes
  testing and setting options more stable.
- Add method to process both superfamilies concurrently with 'sololtr' command to 
  avoid waiting for one to finish before starting to process the other, while
  also handling individual sequences with child processes. This greatly speeds up
  processing, especially for large genomes.
- Store LTR family statistics when classifying LTRs to ensure the data for each
  superfamily is presented together (not split up as other threads are finishing).
- Properly set threads attribute when making LTR family exemplars (was being set to 1
  regardless of options).
- Increase Perl version requirement to 5.14, which is the minimum required to 
  build Bio::DB::HTS.
- Write all errors to STDERR instead of sometimes going to STDOUT for all classes.
- Add the sum of all deletions to report for 'illrecomb' command to get an idea about
  the total DNA removal for an LTR family.

0.04.5	12/12/16	Vancouver, BC

- Modify 'illrecomb' command to take combined LTR family FASTA file instead
  of input directory of classified elements. This prevents having to keep intermediate
  files or regenerate data to calculate patterns of DNA removal.

0.04.4	12/01/16	Vancouver, BC

- Modify 'maskref' command to now generate overlapping subsets of the genome
  (the specifics of the length and overlaps can be changed by the user) for
  masking. This allows more accurate estimates to be gained with very large
  (i.e, megabase sized) subsets, which greatly speeds up the process.
  The overlap size is added to the output table for comparing different parameters.

0.04.3	11/09/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add verbose option to 'findnonltrs' command to monitor progress.
- Add method to remove progress for each chromosome when masking with 'maskref' command
  to same disk space.
- Quiet the build of PAML when configuring dependencies. We still check for errors but the 
  user does not need to see the warnings.

0.04.2	11/05/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add new LTR family joining method that is less stringent. Now families are joined based
  on shared clustering patterns as opposed to the previous requirement of elements having to
  display the exact same clustering pattern to be included in a family.
- Refactor LTR family-finding methods by splitting out clustering methods into separate role.
  Now, the superfamily- and family-finding methods are separated in the command class. We now
  only call algorithms once instead of separately for each superfamily. This allows all the
  methods to be run in parallel (by default).
- Add 'tirage' command for calculating the age of TIR transposons.
- Fix bug with 'maskref' command with so complete refernce is written to final file instead of
  the individual split subsets.
- Adjust the --clean option with 'maskref' command so results may be kept for debugging or other
  purposes.
- Add check to 'maskref' to ensure the correct number of subsets are created from the reference.
- Add option to modify the percent identity threshold for matches with the 'maskref' command.
- Add method to not block when masking reference and generating masking report with 'maskref' command.
  This change results in about 40-50% reduction in runtimes when masking. 
- Add method to avoid hardcoding BLAST+ version so the latest is always fetched properly.
- Add method to run finding exemplars with 'classifyltrs' command in parallel.
 
0.04.1	10/12/16	Vancouver, BC

- Update BLAST+ release.

0.04.0	10/04/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add options for controlling how the solo-LTR finding works. There is a reasonable default now,
  20 families, so that the command will not attempt to do hundreds of alignments and run for
  days or weeks.
- Modify the masking algorithm to give finer control over how stringent the masking should
  be. 
- Parallelize the masking procedure to process chunks of chromosomes (default is 50kb) at a time. 
  This greatly reduces the memory usage and speeds up the process.
- Add method to write a table  of masking results to show what percentage of each repeat type was masked
  in the reference.

0.03.9	09/08/16	Vancouver, BC

- Adjust FASTA header in findhelitrons output to match the ID in the GFF output. Fix
  variable naming issue in Helsearch class with sequence IDs (though it did not appear to
  cause issues it could have because the ID variable was being reused/renamed).

0.03.8	08/30/16	Vancouver, BC
- Configure Tephra to install an HMM library of TE models and a database of tRNA sequences.
  This change reduces the dependencies to only a genome as the input to the search programs.

0.03.7	08/18/16	Vancouver, BC

- Parallelize sololtr command to speed up the solo-LTR search.
- Update the sololtr command usage menu which did not reflect all of the available options.

0.03.6	08/09/16	Vancouver, BC

- Increase BLAST+ package version.
- Simplify install instructions to use latest release only.

0.03.5	07/28/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add reannotate command for transferring annotations from a reference set to Tephra annotations.
- Fix minor issue with help command not being recognized with main tephra command. 

0.03.4	07/06/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for formatting output of illrecomb command (fixes #16 on github).
- Refactor illrecomb methods to not write intermediate files.
- Add method to clean up intermediate results from findnonltrs command.
- Adjust muscle command for sololtr and illrecomb commands to not throw away errors. 

0.03.3	06/24/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for ltrage command. The wrong arguments to muscle were introduced in changes for v0.03.2, which
  has been updated.

0.03.2	06/21/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix in setting the wrong repeat_region ID for elements when evaluating overlaps (fixes #15 on github).
- Bug fix for parsing Helitron IDs from final FASTA file. A minimal parser (no dependencies) was added to the class 
  to account for Bio::DB::HTS::Kseq not parsing anything past the first whitespace. 
- Remove use of clustalw2 everywhere in favor of muscle. This solves a couple of issues, as clustalw2 was quite noisy and
  error-prone when compiling from source.
- Increase default number of matches to consider in LTR family clustering/classification in an arbitrarily large number.
  This will keep families from split based on the size in case there is an unusually large number of matches.

0.03.1	06/09/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add --all option to 'ltrage' command for calculating age of all LTR-RTs in a GFF
  instead of just the default exemplars. This makes getting the age a bit easier now
  by just requiring one command as opposed to one for each superfamily.

0.03.0	06/08/16	Vancouver, BC

- Remove use of SAMtools for indexing/extracting subsequences.
- Remove use of Bio::SeqIO (BioPerl) for parsing sequence files.
- Add Bio::DB::HTS for extracting subsequences and parsing sequences.
- Fix bugs in getting TIR element range (previously off by 1).
- Rework solo-LTR search to look for exemplars and extract LTR features of all
  elements if they are not found. This avoids duplicating work done in the exemplar-finding step.
- Add test file of exemplars to speed up testing (also, no exemplars would be found in
  the small test set)
- Remove use of Bio::Tools::GFF (BioPerl) in favor of Bio::GFF3::LowLevel for parsing GFF features. 
  This is a made a huge performance improvement, as well as simplifying how features would be formatted
  for writing.
- Add strand to non-LTR output (GFF).
- Add the same transposase filtering method to all steps of LTR classification.
- Adjust gap filtering step in non-LTR search to filter elements only in the final stage of classification.

0.02.7	05/06/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix with HMMERv2 path not being set correctly for 'findnonltrs' command.
- Add threshold for percent of Ns in non-LTR-RTs.
- Bug fix to get --help and --man options working correctly.
- Add method to remove leading or trailing gap sequences in 'findnonltrs' command.
- Expand list of transposase-related models to filter prior to LTR family classification.

0.02.6	04/26/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix with LTR-RT exemplar IDs causing issues with generating the LTR exemplar files.
- Bug fix in LTR-RT refinement step to check that elements exist before trying to summarize features.
- Remove used method for getting TE SO terms (added to the 'Util' role to be used by other classes).

0.02.5	04/21/16	Vancouver, BC

- When classifying LTR-RT families, skip transposase domain matches to avoid artifacts in the family assignment.
- Bug fix in 'findhelitrons' command that was writing the coordinates in the wrong order for elements
  on the minus strand.
- Bug fix in the 'make_exemplars' method for the LTR-RT classification, which was writing empty files.
- Standardize IDs with other methods when creating LTR-RT exemplars.
- Add debug option for 'findhelitrons' command to optionally show external commands.

0.02.4	04/07/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add method to standarize FASTA identifiers between GFF and FASTA files for the classifyltrs command.
- Write the element name to the output file of the ltrage command instead of the tree file name. Now the FASTA
  identifier from the combined families file will be written to the ltrage output.
- Add LTR family name to GFF output of classifyltrs command.
- Remove the generation of separate GFF files for each LTR superfamily as this information can be easily
  taken from the annotated GFF file.
- Bug fix for --clean method of ltrage method. A class attribute was missing for this option so it would have
  never worked previously.
- Disable building GUI apps for EMBOSS, which are not used internally.
- Add Perl import for configuration (Net::FTP) which is not available in core for older Perls.

0.02.3	04/04/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for getting URL of deps from sourceforge (which has changed).

0.02.2	  03/17/16    Vancouver, BC

- Fix GO term IDs modified incorrectly during version change.
- Add HMMERv3 to configuration to avoid version issues (HMMERv3 from package manager is too old)
  and to simplify installation for the user.

0.02.1	03/17/16	Vancouver, BC

- Changes to fix threading issue with ltrage command.

0.02	03/15/16	Vancouver, BC

- Improve annotation of unclassifed LTR elements.
- Add option for installation/configuration in any location.
- Add configuration for 'findltrs' command to facilitate finding elements in a broader number of species.
- Add sighandler for BLAST processes.
- Add separate Install/Config classes for easily getting configuration information.
- Add options for controlling the thresholds of matches when annotation LTR elements.
- Add debug option for seeing the external commands that were executed.
- Add 'development' option for skipping long-running commands that require software that I cannot distribute.
- Set up Travis-CI for automated testing. This works efficiently because we are now using pre-built binaries and a pre-configured
  Tephra root directory.

- Add option for substitution rate for ltrage command.
- Add multiple options for controlling the stringency of matches that are counted as real for the sololtrs command.
- Add output of a single collated report from ltrage command instead of individual reports for each element.
- Change input for findnonltrs command from directory of individual sequences to the more convenient multi-FASTA format.

0.01	12/24/15	Vancouver, BC

- Initial release.
